<p>The Virtual Light Company started in the early 1990s as a vehicle for
Justin Couch to effectively get on the internet with a formal presence. In
the early days of the internet in Australia, getting a domain name and IP 
address space required you have a registered business. VLC is part of that.
</p>
<p>Getting online in around 1994 with firstly a large 128K ISDN connection 
to a local ISP (that I provided much technical support to) I registered and
gained access to this domain name as well as my own class C address space. Both
have maintained a continuous presence ever since.</p>
