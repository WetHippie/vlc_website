<h1>The Virtual Light Company History</h1>

<p>The Virtual Light Company started in the early 1990s as a vehicle for
Justin Couch to effectively get on the internet with a formal presence. In
the early days of the internet in Australia, getting a domain name and IP 
address space required you have a registered business. VLC is part of that.
</p>
<p>Getting online in around 1994 with firstly a large 128K ISDN connection 
to a local ISP (that I provided much technical support to) I registered and
gained access to this domain name as well as my own class C address space. Both
have maintained a continuous presence ever since despite several relocations
around the world (didn't that play fun with GEO-IP!).</p>

<h2>Where did the Name Come From?</h2>
<p>
As a passionate reader, particularly of all things Sci-Fi, and my early interest
in Virtual Reality, I spent a lot of time with William Gibson books. After the
Neuromancer series, he wrote a book named 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Light">Virtual Light</a>. This
and my extensive work in VRML, lead to me chosing the name based on the book
title and love of virtual reality.
