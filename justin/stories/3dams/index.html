<h1>WAR 3 Dams Run</h1>

<p>
The 3 Dams run is one of the local runs in Perth WA. As the name suggests,
the route takes in 3 of the local Dams (Mundaring, Canning and Serpentine).
Dams are located in mountains. Mountains mean twisty roads. Twisty roads
mean lots of happy motorcyclists.
</p>
<p>
And so it came to be that, having just gotten my KR1S back on the road
following the Wanneroo off, I needed something to test the bike out. I'd
never done the run before so suggested to the
<a href="http://www.digitalwizards.com.au/">WAR</A> crowd that we
needed to make such a run. The first section through Mundaring is one of
the local pocket runs. About 40km end to end.
</p>
<p>
So on Sunday morning 24th Sept 2000, the mighty WAR crowd met at MacWar East
(McDonalds Midlands). I was busy frantically trying to find the last sets
of nuts and bolts to reassemble the KR while everyone else was meeting.As
usual, I turned up late. Well at least I had an excuse this time! I'd been
up till 2am and spent another 3 hours this morning hastily re-assembling
my bike.

About 18 bikes made it to there. The usual crowd and a few lurkers turned
up. Should be fun as all the fast guys are here. GregR on his modified
'blade (seen below) and the 996 were leading the charge. Up the hill to
Mundaring we go. I shoot off to fill up with fuel (The KR only has a range
of 140km before dropping dead and wanted to make sure I had enough go juice
for the next bit) only to find the servos closed! Head back to where the
group is supposed to be only to find them not there (I'm sure they
mis-interpreted what I'd said!).
</p>
<p>
Assuming the bastards have left without me, I tear off down Mundaring Weir
Rd. Fun ride doing it by yourself. The KR was feeling good, but I wasn't
pushing hard just in case I ran out of go-fast liquid. Coming into the first
drop, just near the hotel the bike suddenly grinds to a halt. Fark. the
bloody thing did run out! After much cursing I look down to notice the
fuel tap in the "on" position - which is really "off" on this bike. Switch
to the prime position and 3 or 4 kicks later I roar off down the road all
happy again.

<p>
At the end of this run is the second meeting point. The Gull servo on
Brookton Highway. Come screaming down the road, being a good GP Racer
wannabe only to find the place devoid of bikes! Hmmmmm. Fill up with petrol
and wait for everyone.
</p>
<p>
At some time later, the first lot come in. Seems like they'd been riding
like the tealady. Every 5 km stopping to admire the view. This stop was no
different.
</p>
<p>
Trying to herd them all into moving for the next stop we finally take off.
Next stop is Canning Dam. Someone volunteers to lead this run. The roads are
tight and twisty and <I>very</I> bumpy. Trees hang out into the road and
there are a lot of blind corners so it makes for some interesting riding
when you meet a 4WD coming the opposite direction in the middle of a corner.
Halfway along this road I notice
that the handlebars seem to be moving around an awful lot. I know this
is a tight, crappy road, but they shouldn't be doing that! Upon stopping
at our next meeting point I look down and notice the distinct sign of some
very loose head bearings. Almost popping out of the bike! Looks like I
didn't torque them down well enough. However, they're not going anywhere too
fast so it should be fine, if not a little rougher than normal.
</p>
<p>
We meet up again and trundle along Albany highway until we hit the
Jarrahdale turn. This section is fast, very fast. I spent most of the time
in top gear with the wrist cocked as far back as it will go. The big bore
bikes disappear into the distance at Warp 10. I spent
most of the ride tucked in behind a M900 until he finally gives up after
being almost torn from the handlebars due to the wind at that speed.
</p>
<p>
Lunch is had at Serpentine Dam. We come across a few other riders there
out for the daily run. The group just about takes over the entire place.
Chairs and tables are acquired from everywhere and we make our usual noisy
cosuming of food presence felt. Much bullshit and general chatter is had. The couple of
local plods that are in our group spend quite a while discussing various
law related things (one of our number had been arrested for Dangerous
Driving earlier in the week).

After the usual rowdy lunch, we mount the cycles again and head home. Going
back the same way we came, made the ride more fun. This time even more
cages were on the road making for some interesting and hairy moments. One
Guy missed a turn and overcooked the corner, resulting in a visit to the
local shrubbery. Luckily he wasn't going very fast at the time and just
ended up with a few scratches and a bruised ego. The ride ended with a few
quite beers at the Mundaring Weir Hotel.
