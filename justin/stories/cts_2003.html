<h2>Chase the Snake 2003</h2>

<p>
Chase the Snake is an annual ride held by the 
<a href="http://www.wetleather.com/">Wetleather</a> list, centered on the town
of Pullman in eastern Washington. Nominally, it is about a ride that follows 
the Snake river, although that seems to be only partially true. This year there
were 40+ bikes there, and thus we split into many smaller groups and went our 
own way. I joined the fast group - otherwise known a <i>Lead, follow or get the
hell out of my way group</i>. To get there, I joined up with fellow aussie
Lindsay Harris. Instead of the usual blast to get there we took a two day 
liesurely (!?!) ride up through Canada. This is the ride report I posted to
the list, with a few embellishments (and photos). 
</p>

<h3>There's a snake in there, and a chair as well...</h3>

<p> 
There are people with games,<br/>
and stories to tell,<br/>
Open wide, come inside,<br/>
It's Play School. <br/>
</p>
<p>
So now that the adrenaline has been removed from the caffine system, a short 
summary of the weekend's events:
</p>

<p>
Lindsay and I decided to leave two days early and go via Canada. We had
freshly minted copies of 
<a href="http://www.destinationhighways.com">Destination Highways</a> for both 
BC and WA and intended to use them in anger!
</p>
<p>
For transportation purposes, my <a href="rsvr_extras.html">aprilia</a> was 
getting jealous of all the time I was spending with the muscular 
<a href="XX2_extras.html">blackbird</a> and wanted some attention all to her
fine italian self. The intent was to clock up a couple of miles for the 9K 
service and run out the current set of tyres (D208GPs). Lindsay was mounted
on the sporty beemer for this occasion.
</p>
<p>
Day 1 had us meeting at I-5/405 before setting off north. Drone up I5 to the
530 exit and then via Darrington to the Cascade Hwy. I'd managed to mostly 
contain my right wrist until this point, just trawling along behind Lindsay.
Fortunately, I overcame my better judgement and started to run a bit faster on
the last section of 530 and Hwy 20 until we filled up at Marblemount. After 
that, it was a speed limit +10 until we get past the Cowboy Sheriff at Newhalem.
Normally he's there, but he wasn't this time. Odd. Oh well, as soon as we're
out of the town, click down a couple of gears and twist the loud handle to the
fullest extent.

It's been quite a few months since I've last pushed a bike really hard on the
road. I'd pushed the XX a bit coming back from my CA trips, but only on faster
sweepers - not the corner after corner of tight 30mph stuff that Hwy20 gives
you. Took a while to settle in to a nice rythmn, but once I did, it was great
fun to be out on the lady again. One thing that took me quite some time to get
used to was the new rear sprocket. The stock gearing is 16/42 which makes 1st
near impossible to use around town - you can't let the clutch out fully until
you're doing 25mph. Based on advice from the aprilia forums, a 44T rear was
installed, and it made a huge difference. Much more controllable on the slow
corners, but it also meant going down the gears has a much smaller gap. In 
fact, when I first pulled up to meet Lindsay, I kicked down through 5th and 
then 4th and the revs barely changed - I thought I'd missed clicking the gear
shift altogether! Now I have (comparatively) barely any engine braking, so that
required quite an adjustment in technique riding this bike.
</p>
<p>
Arriving in Winthrop, we started to instantly melt. Pretty hot out that way! 
Had a snack, downed a litre of water and had a chat with a couple of cruiser
riders that were heading the opposite way on a 5-day trip of their own. You 
could tell the harley rider, because his bike was clean as a whistle, while the
yamaha mounted rider's bike was covered head to toe in bugs - you could barely 
see through the windscreen!
</p>
<p>
Head north along hwy97 and over the border. Guards weren't even interested in
what country I was from, let alone whether I had a passport or not.
</p>
<p>
"Where ya from?"<br/>
"Seattle"<br/>
"Where ya goin'?"<br/>
"For a ride - staying overnight somewhere east of here. I'm with him" 
(pointing at Lindsay)<br/>
"Ok, off ya go"
</p>
<p>
Suppose they don't think the guy with the long blue hair on a very loud 
sportsbike is going to count as a terrorist....
</p>
<p>
Fill up at ossosossyssoosos and then head east along Canada Highway 3. This 
highway has not just one, but three different DH numbers for it! First climb 
up the hill was a struggle for me. Back to metric again, which wasn't much of 
a problem as an indicator, but the really tight corners I couldn't get the 
hang of again. At least one factor in this was the road surface - that really 
light grey, small gravel/tar combo. It's really hard to see what loose stuff 
was on the surface and there were places where it noticably had trucks dragging 
crap from the sides of the road onto the riding line. The other issue was 
mental - here in the US I just don't really get to ride these tight sort of 
roads at all. A typical "twisty" road seems to be 30mph marked corners, with 
maybe the odd 25 thrown in for good measure. In the road diet I grew up on,
they are considered fast sweepers. But, I'm really out of practice on the 
tight stuff, so it made me feel quite uncomfortable for the climb up the hill.
Only at the top did I start feeling a little better, and that showed once we 
hit more later on that day.
</p>
<p>
Cdn Hwy 3 is a rather interesting mix of really tight stuff and big sweepers.
It's a wonderful road to ride - even if all you want to do is look at the 
scenery. Seem one pine tree, seen 'em all - where's the next corner! 
<code>:)</code> Stopped for fuel again and then quickly back on the road again.
</p>
<p>
We'd decided during the day that Nelson looked like a good place to stop. It
would place us about 30 miles from the start of the BC DH1, which we would 
tackle the next morning. I'm in the lead as we pull into town. Pulling into a
carpack just around the corner, I look over to Lindsay to ask him where he'd
like to crash for the evening. Noticed the Best Western behind him, but waited
for his response: Well that place looks as good as any - look we're already in
their carpark!
</p>
<p>
Decision made.
</p>
<p>
Wander over, check in, get changed and head down to dinner. Lovely NY steak 
with peppercorn sauce, a couple of beers and then a wander around town.

Wake up Friday morning to the sight of wet roads, but luckily no rain. 
Deciding that we'd have breakfast after the ferry ride, we pack up and mount
the bikes. The little section of Hwy 3A up to the Lake Kootenay Ferry is 
populated, so there's no chance of really moving along. That's good because 
the roads were damp, and very light drizzle, but nothing really serious.
</p>
<p>
Arriving at the ferry, we discover that the timetable given by DH is 
completely useless. We're about 50 minutes too early for the ferry. I was in 
need of petrol, but the servo looked really dodgy, so decided to fill up on the
other side. But... the bakery looked good so we had breakfast there. At last
- a Lemon and poppyseed muffin! My favourite. The poppyseed cakes and muffins 
in the US never seem to include the lemon bit - always almonds. A cuppa with 
the muffin and we notice a couple more bikes pulled up at the front of the 
queue. Wandering over to chat we're informed we should head to the front (ala
Seattle ferries). Just as we're doing so, two more bikes pull up along side us
and then follow to the front. The collection is now - oldish Goldwing, a 
harley, a Triumph Trophy, VFR, mille, R1100RT and a yamaha cruiser of some
description.
</p>
<p>
Heading onto the ferry, Lindsay and a couple of the lead bikes almost get 
taken out by a couple of motorists too keen on getting on the ferry.  Once 
loaded, we head off up the lake. Very picturesque. Lush green valleys, over 
blue water and low clouds. I imagined trolls, hobbits, dwarves and elves 
poking their heads out at the strange visions passing by.

<p>
After leaving the ferry, we filled up again and, taking a suggestion from a
couple of the other riders, waited for the traffic to clear, having another 
coffee in the process. This is DH1, and the only way onto the northern end of 
it was via the ferry. If you time it just right, you hit the road just before 
the next ferry arrives, leaving maximum time for the traffic from the last 
ferry to have cleared the end of the road.
</p>
<p>
At last we hit the road, and it's every bit as good as the book makes it out 
to be. Corner after corner after corner of 30-60km/h marked road. Lovely 
smooth hotmix too, at no time did I ever have to watch the grip levels 
available. I caught the Trophy rider about a third of the way down and about 
two-thirds came across the VFR rider. Flew past him and continued on my very 
merry way - stopping at the end to wait for Lindsay to catch up: Ear to ear 
smiles all around!
</p>
<p>
The plan was to get to Pullman fairly early yet still have fun, so we head 
back west along hwy3 until we hit the border crossing on Hwy 21. Simple run 
back through there again (they wanted to check my passport this time!) and 
head through to Metaline. Arrive at the township getting low on go-juice and 
start looking around. Uh oh - no petrol stations! GPS finding says nearest is 
32 miles from here. I'm on reserve already, which means I'd never make that!
Ask a local and it seems we're not quite where we think we are! Metaline falls,
and a couple of places for fuel are just a couple of miles down the road. 
Phew!
</p>
<p>
Filling up, we start chatting with some guy in a clapped-out car there. blah 
blah blah, usual-chat-with-stranger-thing. Next thing I know and he's grabbed
box out from a bag next to him
</p>
<p>
"Wanna buy a toolkit for the bike?"<br/>
"eh?"<br/>
"Oh.... No thanks."
</p>
<p>
Oddball sales tactic for fell-off-the-back-of-a-truck gear. Anyway, bit of 
refueling the body and we head off down 21, then ID41, Hwy95 and so on.
Heading down 95 and we're running fairly slowly behind traffic. Not only 
that, but the lead car was sitting somewhere between 5 and 15mph below 
the speed limit - constantly changing speed. ARRGGHHH! Getting the shits with
it all, I drop back to second and pass Lindsay and the three cars over a 
double yellow and hit clear roads again in about all of two seconds flat 
(while trying to keep the front wheel on the ground and shifting gears as the
bike bounces off the rev limiter). We'd been travelling a bit slowly because 
we thought I'd be stretching the fuel range by taking 130miles between stops.
Traditionally my mille had only managed 120mi before the light would come on
and I'd get another 15mi or so after that. Well, I gave the bike a good 
thrashing after passing the cars - screeming through corners at ton plus.
Onto 270 and continue to nail it. No matter what I did, the light just didn't
come on - several times hitting Ludicrous Speed on the straight sections. 
Only just as I hit the edge of town, at 136mi, did the light finally come on!
Hmm... maybe the bike is starting to break in - at 8000miles on the clock?
</p>
<p>
More fuel, and I'm off leading again, heading down hwy27 towards Pullman. This
road offers a lot of really nice sweepers in amongst the green wheat fields. 
I get into a nice rythmn here again, settling in at about 80-90mph and just 
rolling with the curves. left, right, left, right, straight..., left, 
right... Finally ending as I pulled up to a stop at the northern outskirts of 
Pullman to wait for Lindsay to show.
</p>
<p>
Waiting, waiting, waiting....
</p>
<p>
Decide to take helment off, ah, there's Lindsay - doh! Suit up and meander 
off to find the hotel for the weekend.
</p>
<p>
Arrive to the site of Gooz up on the balcony, plastic cup of beer in hand,
Ducati out front and a couple of other bikes I don't recognise (colour-matched
almost identical orange harleys). Checking in and along comes a a metallic 
orange GoldWing trike. Not any old trike mind-you! It's a brand new one with
the full conversion done to it. Much dollars invested in this one Cap'n!
Even had this funky cantilevered trailer, that more than one person went 
looking for the wheels on. Elderly couple doing a multi-week tour of the north
west.
</p>
<p>
After much gas-bagging and a few more bikes turn up, Lindsay and I head out 
to JT's for some dinner. Starving after a long day! There's about 5 bikes at
the point we arrive, and Randall's easily seen along with a couple of other
vaguely familiar faces. Intros all-round and then head inside to grab a beer
and tucker. Very, very yummy lasagne and garlic bread! Back out to eat it at
the table and slowly more motorcycle scum turn up. Coincidently, most of them
seemed to be named Brian....
</p>
<p>
The sun is setting, so I decide to wander back to the hotel. Gooz apparently
has more beer floating around. At least I could drink and not have to worry 
about the ride back. Reach into pocket to grab glasses (not sunnies) and come 
out with an arm, one lense and the frame. Oops.... screw had fallen out. Feel 
around inside pocket and found the screw still there, but decided to hot-foot
it for the hotel first and then try to repair them later. Head back to the 
hotel with an almost set sun and wearing sunglasses. At least Lindsay's tail 
light is bright :) More beer, more people, more bikes. Get told to shut up 
because we're making too much noise. Go to sleep.

</p>
Wake up Saturday morning and head over to breakfast. No sign of Randall until
I'm leaving. Get prepped and then wander about the carpark looking lost and
trying to find the "group that goes fast". Ah, seems that I need to follow
Randall. Will be riding with a few other nut cases. Good.  Randall tries to
explain where we're going, but it goes in one ear and out the other. Bugger 
it, I'll just follow him and hope my maps have enough detail if I get lost.
</p>
<p>
First section of the day is uneventful other than having problems with Randall 
throttling off about halfway around a car when overtaking and having the 
following 6 bikes just about run up his arse every time! Not so bad for Gooz
and I on V-twins that have a large amount of engine braking when throttling 
off, but the others are having real problems. At this point, I also notice the
guy in front of me on the beemer doesn't look to be particularly safe either. 
He's really twitchy on the road. Lane changes to overtake etc are positively 
dangerous. These oddball flicks of the handlebars and cutting corners etc. I
decide it's far safer to be in front of him than behind.
</p>
<p>
After getting to the top of the Spiral Highway and finding it closed, we head 
off somewhere north on hwy95, I think. Dunno. Just following Randall, who has
now, after getting his arse chewed out by everyone at the stop, improved his
overtaking technique so that he doesn't score a six-bike wedgie every time.
</p>
<p>
First set of corners we encounter is Winchester Grade. Lotsa tight stuff here.
After about the first couple of handfuls of corners, Rob F gets the shits with
hanging behind Randall's slowish pace and takes off - overtaking 5 of us at
once, then diving into a tight left-hander, and just about parting company 
with the bike as he hits a huge mid-corner dip and tosses him really badly. A
few corners later and Brett heads off after him. I'm tempted to do the same, 
but I'm just not feeling quite comfortable. The guy on the beemer is still
looking really dangerous so I've made up my mind I <i>must</i> get around him
sooner rather than later, but I'm still not really up to pushing the bike
through the tight corners yet. Right-handers are fine, but the left-handers
give me the wobblies. As we get closer to the top, I finally get a bit of 
straight road and rip past Randall and the beemer (still no idea who the guy
was at this stage) and take off over the very broken surface. Come across Rob
and Brett having a smoko on the side of the road, slow down, but Randall's
still coming at full pace so wick it up again and take off down the road 
(later learning that I'd showered them all in rocks from the sticky rear 
tyre in the process).
</p>
<p>
Slow down for a town and let Randall take the lead again. Follow him through
the next series of highways. We climb a small ridge and the road opens to two
lanes. Just then Randall points up at a bike yellow and black warning sign - 
twisty road, next 8 miles. You fucking beauty! Drop a couple of cogs and fly 
past him like he's standing still. Roll into the first 55mph marked corner 
and just nail the throttle. About the third or fourth corner I sneek a 
peeking the mirrors and see Brett behind me at a reasonable distance - the
fun has started! Keeping it in 3rd and 4th and just tickling the rev-limiter
I'm really enjoying the high-speed downhill run (later I find this is called
the New Whitebird Grade) Rolling from sweeper to sweeper, just hanging off 
the bike a bit, leaning right over and powering through the corners, throttle
off a little to set entry speed for the next one. Lather, rinse, repeat.
</p>
<p>
Oh fuck.....
</p>
<p>
Copper...
</p>
<p>
I've come flying around a right-hander and noticed a set of flashing party
lights on the next corner down - a left-hander. Immediately closing the 
throttle and applying a large dose of brakes, I go past him somewhat (ok,
a hell of a lot!) guilty looking. The guy is standing beside the open door of
the mobile home that has broken down and giving me the really evil eye. Ah
bugger it, there's no way he could catch me, so as soon as I'm around the next
corner, it's business-as-usual. The descent is wonderful fun. No matter what
speed I'm doing, the bike is rock-solid in the corners. In fact, if I'd had 
the leathers on, I'd be going another 20mph faster in the corners and dragging
the knee. Not a hint of movement from either the chassis or the super-sticky
tyres!
</p>
<p>
Finally we hit bottom and I pull off to the side at the little intersection 
and wait for the others to turn up. (Brett later comments that the tyres were
so hot that as I pulled off, I had a huge rooster-tail of rocks slinging up 
behind the back of the bike - well over my head in height he said). Turn right
into Whitebird and immediately stop. Sheriff's car has the road blocked off 
for some parade thing. Lots of really young girls tarted up to look like much
older girls, I'd say most of them weren't older than 10. Pretty sad really
that their parents can get away doing that shit to them. Anyway, after some
time the road is opened and we (almost literally) walk the bike through town.
</p>
<p>
On the other side, it opens up and once again we're back into holigan mode. 
Randall, beemer, me, FJs x2 and Goozman. First few corners start to up the
pace again. Once again, the beemer rider is scaring the shit out of me. Four
corners in a row and he's completely cut them way too tight. On the fourth
corner, he's all but clipped a cylinder on the bank on the inside of the 
corner (he had to lift the bike and correct the line pretty savagely to avoid
contact), the previous ones he's cut well inside the slowly fading white line
well before the apex. I simply cannot follow this guy because he's going to
bin it sooner rather than later and probably take me with him. So after the
fourth corner I pull a fairly dangerous hairball move on the exit of the 
inside of a blind left-hander to get past him. After that, I follow Randall 
up the slopes through the hairpins. Not knowing the road, and the road 
conditions are fairly dodgy (we'd already come through one corner where
the road was completely covered in gravel) I decide to sit behind Randall
and let him set the pace.
</p>
<p>
Lucky I did, because we've come around a left-hand hairpin in about the 
middle of the road, to find a sheriff's 4wd slowing down to a stop, just
inside the exit of the corner. Pretty bloody dumb place to park the car 
- right where you can't see it. Didn't have any problems avoiding him, 
although I think the others had issues, and he gives us the Evil Stare 
again. I think it's the same guy I went screaming past at Mach 1 on the
way down the hill. Anyway... we finish the climb and pull over for a 
photo shoot and rest at the lookout.

<p>
More highway droning and then Hit ID13. The entrance is a long downhill slope.
This is really nice road and Randall is really holding me up. I really want to
go far faster than he is, but there's just not the oppourtunity to do so. Lots
of tight corners, with no straights in between. I'm 6th in the group, with 
only Gooz behind me, who is lagging quite a lot. At the bottom there's an 
intersection with ID14. No sign of the Duc, so I pull over to wait for him.
It will also give me a good chance to get an open piece of road where I can 
set my own pace.
</p>
<p>
A couple of minutes later and gooz shows up. I nail it and start the run 
through the valley. A gorgeous piece of road and within a minute I'm flying 
up on the back of the group. I watch the pace for about 30 seconds and decide
that the road is too good to waste. Overtaking everyone in two moves, I then
set out at a fairly brisk pace just watching the corners and using throttle 
and, occasionally, gears to set the right speed - never needing to touch the 
brakes. That is, until I round a right-hander and find sitting on my side of
the road, an old batter truck parked, facing me. FAAARRRCK! Anchors out, but 
not drastically, and I go around him. At this point I also notice Brett is 
behind me again, so up the tempo goes and we enjoy a fun blast through the 
country-side at something highly-illegal in speed terms. Gorgeous pavement 
and sight-lines though, so doing excessive speeds and lots of lean-angle is
not a problem here. Once again, the priller is just completely gorgeous to 
right. Absolutely rock solid. Apart from watching the roads, my mind keeps 
going over the fact that I'm just _so_ glad I spent the extra money and 
purchased this bike. It's times like these where it really comes into it's
own. It's a horrible bike to ride around town or along the I-5, but put 
corners in it's way, and there's really nothing that can beat it for pure 
riding pleasure.
</p>
<p>
We stop in a town starting with K that nobody can remember the name of, nor
pronounce properly. Little joint that advertises shakes and burgers. Sounds
good. After doing the ritual undress we walk inside. I scare the locals. We
order lunch - BLT and some water will do just fine thanks. Water's delivered,
gooz gets up to take a leak and promptly decides I'm a smelly bastard and 
that I need a wash, tipping my glass of water all over me and the floor! 
Thanks mate... Yummy lunch, and the crew decide the fireworks shop across 
the road looks like a good place to visit. Luckily Rob F brought the 
hardbags on his FJ :)
</p>
<p>
As we saddle up after lunch, we all promise to take it a bit slower. Food 
in belly dims the reactions etc etc. About 5 minutes out of town and that's
quickly forgotten! A few more sweepers, then back to the highway to the last 
set of curves for the day. Randall back in front again.
</p>
<p>
The final run is an uphill climb, then along a plateau and back down a 
valley. No idea what the name of this road is, but it sure as hell was a fun
ride. Once again, I find Randall holding me up in the corners. Brett's in 
front of me so he takes the first pass and then I get the next one. A car in 
the way on a short straight stretch is easily dealt with and Brett and I 
head off at silly speeds through the corners again.  I feel Brett is holding 
me up just a little - particularly later on as I keep running up the back of 
him in the corners. I'm probably doing 5mph faster than him in corner speed. 
I'm now starting to feel far more comfortable on the tight stuff compared 
to both earlier in the morning and the days before. Something just clicked 
and now where I was struggling to maintain a good corner speed, now I just 
would roll in, crack the throttle and accelarate through the corner.
</p>
<p>
Near the top, Brett waves me past and so I take off. I up the tempo again 
from our already fast pace. The roads were nice and clear here. Good lines, 
well marked and the surface was more good than bad. Not caring about the 
others I just roll with my own speed, pushing a little, but not too
uncomfortable levels. Brett's still there, Rob F a little way back. As usual 
on group riding, it's far easier to be following someone than to lead. Things
are rocking along really nicely until, once again we come around a corner only 
to discover a guy in a truck towing a boat (I think) was about to enter the 
road. Grabbing a moderate handful of brakes (this being the 4-pad Brembos, so 
that's all you really need to stop NOW) the guy quickly shifts into reverse 
and gets off the roadway. Resume our usual story.

The downhill section was quite a challenge. Having had a number of crashes 
due to front end slides, I'm always hesitent about driving too much weight on
the front wheel. I'm even more hesitent when it comes to downhill corners. 
Yet, this time I'm riding through fairly hard, but with an extra layer of 
caution thrown in. Just as well, as on the way down, there are a number of 
corners that, mid way through develop some really nasty set of ripples and/or
"speedbumps". A couple of times I'm about to roll in, only to notice the 
shadows, so having to brake and correct the line as I'm entering the corner. 
I'm mostly successful at doing this, but a couple I'm not, and they certainly 
test out the steering damper's capabilities. Luckily, though upsetting, 
nothing serious gave me a fright. At the bottom, Brett and I pull over and 
have a chat - both with huge grins on our faces. Seems that things were fairly
even I had greater corner speed, but he was going in faster than me, and 
accelerating the same on the way out. That seemed to gel with what I was 
experiencing when our roles were reversed with me continually climbing up the
back of him in the corners.

We regroup and set off again for the slow trip home. No more twisties for the 
day, just a few sweepers. Back to the hotel, have a drink of water and head 
out to JT's again for dinner.  Yummy dinner again, but had to be really 
careful. I have a severe allergy to fish - can't even be in the same area as 
it when it is cooking - so some special care from Chris, to bring me food 
from inside the house was hugely appreciated!

More gasbagging, then head back to the hotel for a few more beers on the 
verandah, before finally crashing out at around 11pm.

Sunday morning starts the same way as Saturday. I was originally going to 
spend an extra day in Pullman and then take a day or two to get home, riding
with Lindsay. However, my activities of the days previously had trashed the 
rear tyre far faster than I was expecting. Despite riding in a fashion that 
was deliberately designed to wear out the outsides of the tyre (hard 
acceleration in mid corner and then rolling off the throttle as the bike came
upright) I'd worn right down to the wear indicators in the middle! Oh well, 
not good. Limp-back to Seattle time. I offer my appologies to Lindsay and 
organise to head home with Gooz and a very relaxed pace.

We're out of there by 8am and on the road through the green hillsides. If I
was able to smell anything, it would have been gorgeous. Unfortunately I have 
close to zero sense of smell, so I got to enjoy the visuals instead. Gooz 
sat right on the speedlimit the entire way. First along 195, then 26 and 
then 261 as we headed north to the Inland Passage  and finally onto the I-90.
Stopping for Pertol in Vantage, we head back out onto the Old Vantage Hwy and 
head west. Getting to Ellensberg, I'm so tempted to toss on the left 
indicator and head up hwy97 to take hwy 2 over the mountains, rather than 90. 
However, considering the state of my rear tyre, I decided that probably wasn't
a good idea and so continued plodding west. Traffic has picked up now and is 
really inconsistent. The speeds were all over the place. Nobody was holding a 
constant speed, which really pisses me off. It's worse when you're behind 
another bike, so I decide to go around Gooz and do my own thing. I peg the 
speed at Speed Limit + 3mph I maintain a steady pace towards home. There was 
one woman who was really annoying - she'd speed up to 10-15 over the limit, 
race up past a few cars and then immediately drop back to 5 under. Whereupon
the cars would all pass her again. She did this probably 10 times before it
annoyed me enough to do something about it, so I sped up, got well in front 
of her and then resumed normal activities.

From this point on, the trip home was really uneventful. Coming off I-90 into
the downtown area got me some funny looks from the Pioneer Square crowd. 
Sportsbike black with bugs and tail bags, rider with similar look (visor was
coated with bugs too!). Seemed to confuse a lot of people. Got home, unloaded
and then had to start prepping for Mark and Meredith to show up some time 
later. Mark had an interview the next day and was going to crash at my place 
for the night.
</p>
<p>
All in all a great trip! Canada has some fantastic roads that I need to 
explore more of, so does Idaho. 1600miles and a shagged rear tyre are the 
products of the efforts. Good fun! When can I do it again?!
