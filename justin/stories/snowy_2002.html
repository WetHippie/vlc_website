<h2>Snowy Mountains 2002</h2>

<p>
Mid November 2002 was the scene of a a recreation of
<a href="snowy_2001.html">last year's</a> large fundraising ride centred around
Jindabyne in the Snowy Mountains region of NSW and ACT. Last year we left on
the Friday, but we expected there to be a lot more bikes and police presence
there this year, so we left a day earlier. The idea was to have fun getting
there, then have a day on the roads to ourselves and on the saturday do
some spirited cruising but not all-out hooliganism of the previous days,
followed by a cruise back home on the Sunday. Now that I'm living in the USA,
I had to travel home for this one. I also came armed with a digital camera
this time, so many more photos were taken. I didn't get many on-road shots
because I was waaaay too busy enjoying myself to be taking photos....
</p>
<p>
So last's year's ride was about trashing tyres, this year it has to be about
not trusting them enough to trash them. Some back story....
</p>
<p>
Living in the USA has left my two bikes in Sydney. The Vtd is going to be
purchased from me by my mate Chris, who's been looking after it for me. When
last I saw my bike, it was a bit on the rough side. I'd just thrown it down the
road on turn 11 at Eastern Creek due to a misfiring engine (misfire right on
the transition point from full brakes to rolling into the corner, leading to
the rear trying to swap ends with the front). During that time, it had been back
to Mladin's - yes that Mladin. None other than Mat's store here in Narellan. I
know Mat pretty well and when he opened the store that is where I started
taking my bike for servicing. At one point I needed the regular cam-chain
tensioners replacement. This didn't end up coming back from the shop right.
Strange thing was that it was not consistent. Sometimes it would run right,
others it ran like shit. Several times it went back to be looked at but they
didn't "find" anything. Anyway, after my off, Chris lifted the heads and found
the front cylinder intake port was out by one tooth. Pretty huge timing
problem! Anyway, it went back to the shop like this with orders to Fix It.
Grumble, grumble from Mat's new mechanics (AFAICT his race mechanics from his
team in the US). From all reports, pretty sultry guys, probably not used to
customer service oriented things.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the bike comes back from them all fixed, but everything is completely
out of whack. Suspension setups wound back to zero, chain loose, everything. Not
happy Jan. So it takes Chris quite some time to dial the bike back in again - to
his weight, which is about 15kgs heavier than me. The tyres are looking pretty
shot too from the recent track daying, so we decide to put some new ones on. The
RSVR boards here have been raving about the new Sportec M1's, and through our
racing contacts have a source of very cheap tyres, so we decice to put a set on
for this trip.
</p>
<p>
Around this time, I arrive back in Sydney and the adventure begins properly. It's
Wednesday the 13th November. Picking up my bike from Chris' place I trundle off to
deal with the usual set of chores. Stupid bank canceled my credit card on me
because I hadn't used it in ages, do some shopping etc. Dropped into Mladin's
to see what was up and talk about things. Wandered around to the shop area to
meet the mechanics and get greeted by Mat himself - in full shop atire, working
on a customer's chookie doing a clutch and rings replacement. How many other
top-level racers would you find doing that in an off-season? Despite what you
read of him in the international press, he is one of the most grounded racers
you will find. As I've found out, non-aussies just don't understand our
attitudes particularly well. (I pity the poor Japanese Kawasaki mechanics that
are going to have to deal with both Pitt and McCoy (another Camden local) in
the same team!). Anyway... in the back of the shop there's one of his racebikes
that is being put together for next season. At least that's what it looks like.
I wasn't allowed to take any photos of it, but it looks awfully like it (side
note, Chris was telling me of the problems Mat had turning up to one of the
local FX rounds with his "test" bike for next year. Seems top-shelf Ohlins
equipment is not permitted under Superbike rules).

<p>
The next day rolls around and it's Chris turning up at 0715 to do a quick bit
of work on the bike. When he'd been sorting the suspension back out, he put the
forks back to stock settings. Not good, Every corner I went around it felt like
it was trying to tuck the front under. With his help, we dropped them back
through to the 12mm that they used to be - much better feel now.
</p>
<p>
Off we trundle down to Maccas for the regulation 0800 meet. In all, 5 bikes turn
up and off we wander. The plan is to go through the back roads, pick a couple
more up at Picton and then head down some more backroads to Marulan and then
down Clyde Mountain from Braidwood.
</p>
<p>
Arriving at the King George IV, we're greeted by 3 bikes, not 2. Seems that
Murray has managed to scarf a bike for the trip. Amazingly, he's found a rat
bike that's more ratty than his own! What's more, we start to see the first
signs of what could be a problem later on - the Ventura rack on the (brand new)
O2 VFR is bending. The problem is a poor design with too thin a metal plate
being used where it bolts into the passenger grab-bars. As a result, the flexing
with the weight of the back is causing the mount to bend and the whole lot is
decending on the rather expensive rear indicators. Not good! It's actually
quite soft - you can bend it back to the right spot with very little effort.

<p>
The next stop is the Marulan truck stop. We get there via the usual backroads
around Bargo and the Mount Gibralter lookout. These are the typical fun roads,
tight twisty stuff, really bumpy and only Murray and I had been on them before
so it shocked a few of the other riders. To placate them, there's a short 20km
stretch of the Hume to do before we wander down the next road, but a short stop
and refuel for the thirsty Vtd is needed. They laugh at you for having a limited
range tank (ie 160km roughly, and less when on the gas) particularly when most
there could down one stop to my three! Oh well, another excuse to have something
to eat and drink - and get accosted by Japanese tourists. No kidding - we've all
pulled out of the main fuel up area for a group shot here and a busload of
Japanese tourists descends on us, camera's clicking away madly. A couple want
shots sitting on our bikes, so we oblige Kev's bike (The Blue Meanie) for the
purpose. Also, blue hair seems quite strange to them and they want to take frotos
of me. Gaaaa. Oh well, better oblige.
</p>
<p>
Off we head down towards Braidwood. There's some big open roads here. So far,
we'd been relatively sedate. The scenery is really nice, even for drought
country (98% of the state is officially drought-striken right now) so I pull
alongside Sharon, the current ride lead, make camera motions and then gun
the throttle. Next 10km is spent with the throttle pinned in top. Uh, guys,
that's wasn't your cue to follow me! I was trying to get some distance between
myself and the group so that I could get off and take some nice photos. Didn't
work as almost everyone followed me on the high-speed jaunt. All I managed to
get was the photo on the right of Graeme and Julie on the 02 as they were
taking a much more gentlemanly pace than most of us hoons.

We arrive at Braidwood, which is our intended next fueling stop for the
thirsty Vtd. It's only about 120km from our last, so I'm not on the fumes
stage, but since we know what's coming up is going to be some full throttle
blasting, then I really should fill up as the next stop is 60km down the road.
Pulling into the Ampol servo, we're greated with the owner telling us that
the entire town is in a blackout and there's no idea when the power will come
back on. Uh oh..... both Sharon and I are now worried - 80km of fun stuff ahead
and very little juice to do it on. Bugger! Time for an exercise in smooth riding
and constant positioning of the loud handle. We stop for a rest anyway as Graeme's
rack is causing more problems. Various options were tried, but the one that ended
up being used was to put the strap of the bag around the shoulders of Julie, his
pillion and get her to lean forward a bit. Not the best, but cheaper than having
to replace an entire tail light assembly. Also during this time, a number of guys
were complaining about chewing up their rear tyre on the high-speed stuff. A quick
look reveals the obvious problem - bikes set up for a rider are not set up for
rider with a heavy bag on the back. So out come the tools and we bump up the rear
preload a couple of clicks on most of the bikes there. This proves, later, to be
exactly the problem and the guys comment on how well their bikes handle again.

Oh, and of course, I needed repairs too. My Old Faithful Alpinestars are
slowly disintegrating on me. These are the one's I've worn everywhere. The
<a href="oz_trip.html">round-Oz trip</a>, touring throughout the eastern
states and daily commuter boots. They've had three soles on them now and I
think it's about time they got tossed. Buuuut... They still had to last me
for the this trip. A little bit of minor roadside repairs were needed before
the run down the mountains. The previous jaunts at well over the double ton
had caused the bottom of one to start to peel off.
</p>
<p>
The trip down Clyde Mountain was interesting and fun. This is the local milk
run for the Canberra-based motorcyclists. It's about 60km of fast sweepers
followed by 15km of steep downhill, with a lot of slow 20km/h <i>marked</i>
downhill hairpins thrown in for good measure. We managed a fairly good run, but
at this point I start to notice a number of things about the handling - the
front is sitting too high, it bounces around like crazy and the rear is too
soft for the extra weight of the bags and the front brakes suck severely.
Also, the lack of front wheel grip is really starting to get to me. At this
point I feel its a suspension setup issue, so I'll play with that first.
</p>
<p>
Arriving at Nelligen, which is at the 60km mark and the bottom of the big
twisties,  I wander off in search of the fuel pump. I found it. Looks like
a prop out of a 1920's silent film. Deciding that I really don't need gummed
up carbies, I opt to see how far I can stretch the reserve light and make a
(slow-speed, petrol-conserving) run for Bateman's Bay along with Robin, a
newish rider mounted on a CBR600F3. Hitting the town, we saunter down the
first turn off where the fuel sign points. Bloody hell, where is this servo?
We're about 8km along the road and I'm sure there's nothing left in the tank
and finally we find one. 15.3L of Optimax later (16L tank) and neither of us
have seen the rest of the group. Wonder where everyone went? Hmmm.
</p>
<p>
We back-track and find them at the intersection that we'd originally turned
down. Surprisingly, Gordon's recently rebuilt silver VFR is surrounded with
tools. This does not look good. Says there's some pulsing in the clutch and
other rattly noises coming from the engine department. There's already a number
of guys playing with the bike so Robin and I head off to the adjacent Maccas
for a bite to eat. Returning later, we find all the bikes moved (sensibly)
under some shade, and Gordon's bike doing the best impression of a
Harley Davidson - see the pics below:

About an hour later, a local biker rides by and casts his eye over what is
going on. "You know there's a Honda shop half a mile down the road?" Sheeeit.
Thanks mate. So the VFR is hastily reassembled and the rider nurses the bike
down the road. The mechanic has a bit of a look at it then. Lots of confusing
things and various bits of engine are removed one at a time until the source of
the problem is found - the inner bearing of the gearbox input shaft has
completely disintegrated. It's a pull the engine and split the cases job to fix.
Gordon's bike is taking no further part in this trip. Arrangements are hastily
made with rearranging bags and pillions and extra setup to accomodate the now
bike-less Gordon. He end's up riding Sharon's 800 (extra grunt for the pillion)
and Sharon rides a pillion.
</p>
<p>
During the run down Clyde Mountain, I'd firmly made up my mind that these pads
were going to kill me at some stage during the weekend. They had absolutely no
feel to them at all. You couldn't tell whether they were on or not, when the
pickup point was etc. The pads were a trial set courtesy of another of our
racing links. It was a new brand to Oz (Goldsomethingorother) and was interested
in our impression of the. Mine: They're deadly. I could not recommend them to
anyone. My original intention was to pick up a replacement set at Cooma on
the way through to Jindabyne, but since we'd stopped at a Honda shop, I made
the appropriate enquiries. $110 later and a new set of EBC HHs were in my
possesion. Things out the back were taking their time so I borrowed a couple of
tools and fitted them on the spot. A number of laps of the carpark and hard braking,
running with brakes on etc etc had them sufficiently bedded in to not be dangerous.
A few others then jumped on the bike to feel it out and all decided that the EBC's
were the way to go too and would fit some after the trip. More suspension twiddling
too. One less turn of front preload, half turn extra rebound, that should sort
out the front.
</p>
<p>
Back on the road again, we head off towards Bega. Mostly legal speeds through
here as the cops are fairly notorious. However, as we came down the hill into
Bega at somewhere well over illegal speeds (someone claimed it was 180km/h - dunno,
was shitting myself at the time), I reckonised the familiar shape of
a paddy wagon coming down the hill on the side road. Hauling on the (now much
better) front brakes brought us some stern looks, but they didn't have radar
so we're lucky. Not to mention the fact that we must have looked really guitly
as the next turn was a service station and we all turned into it! More filling
up was needed anyway, but just the timing made it look much worse.
</p>
<p>
The front felt more planted, but still very vague, but now the rear felt
horrible. Every time I opened the throttle a bit or hit a tar snake it felt
like it was sliding on me. Pulling up for petrol and Murray (who had been
closely tagging me on this stretch) had this huge grin on his face. "You should
see the huge black lines you were laying down in every corner! Fantastic!" Oh,
that explains it all. A cursorary look at the rear tyre and sure enough, the
tell-tale signs of spinning up the rear were quite evident on the outer couple
of inches of tyre. Just completely polished. Basically the back wasn't coping
with the power, so two extra turns of preload (for the bag weight), two more
clicks of rebound damping and three fewer clicks of compression damping should
be about right (got to love having Ohlins suspension!).
</p>
<p>
Fueled up, we head up Brown Mountain. This is basically the same as Clyde
Mountain - 10km of tight (ie 25-35km/h marked) corners with some really nice
tarmac and steep uphill climb - just the thing for a sportsbike rider. Murray
heads off first and I valiently try to chase. Come to the first really tight
corner and my brain starts "so, that's a tiiight corner, what am I supposed to
do again?". I completely screw it up. Over on the wrong side of the road, I'm
just completely out of practice with these really tight corners. Over in the US,
the slowest corners they seem to have are marked at 30mph - 50km/h roughly. I'm
completely out of practice on this really gnarly stuff. Unfortunately, there's
someone behind me. Not sure who it is, but I think it's Gordon/Sharon and they're
catching me! Oh the shame! It takes me probably 15 corners before I've started
to get into the grove again. The rear suspension mods and dropping the front
pressure down to 32psi have worked wonders. Now I can really drive the bike
out of the corners and expect the rear to hook up properly. The front still
feels really vague, but at least it is gripping the road now. Having the rear
gripping properly helps as it allows me to reduce the load on the front and
makes the issue less relevant. By half way up the hill I'm flying. I've caught
Murray  almost and the bike behind has disappeared. Much better. I can see
Murray ahead of me now. Almost got him. Arrggghh! F@*&$^%, I've come flying
around a 25km/h left hander only to find a full semi doing all of walking pace
up the hill. Hard on the brakes I avoid running up the back of it. Very lucky
I've fitted the new pads because no doubt the old ones I would have locked up
or just failed to stop in time.
</p>
<p>
A corner or two later I get around the truck and head up the rest of the road.
Now it starts to widen out as we hit the top of the range. Murray's in sight
again, so I nail the throttle and then just tag him all the way to the next
town. There we stop for everyone to catch up and then head on to Cooma. This
bit is a blast. Open country with little wind and big sweepers. The throttle
spends most of its time pinned to the stop. On one long straight I see about
265 on the speedo, but this bike is out due to gearing changes and then Murray
drifts past me just as I start to back off a bit for the next "corner". A later
check of the calibrated speed reveals my top speed of 218km/h and Murray claims
he say 270 on his speedo, so probably got to 225 real. As each bike pulls up
in Cooma there's a huge shit-eating grin on each rider. <i>Everyone</i> had
been doing the same thing - 40 odd kilometres of just flat out blasting.
</p>
<p>
Deciding not to fill up, we head off towards Jindabyne. That was a mistake.
About 5km out of Bellingen the reserve light comes on. No probs, I'll just
fill up there. Arriving into town I'm greated by a sign that says 28km to
Jindabyne and everything is shut. Darn country towns - it's only 7pm! I'd never
gone more than 25km on reserve before, this is going to be a real test as
there are more fantastic roads down this way. So I settle in for a slow cruise
at the legal speed limit. Pity that, but it is starting to get dark and it's
roo time so probably a wise thing to do anyway.
</p>
<p>
Running on fumes (33km!) I roll into Jindabyne and find our lodging for the
weekend. We'd again picked Mad Mooses, same place as last year. Great little
lodge.

So after getting all set up and changed into somewhat normal clothing, we
wander off to the town for some dinner. It's just after 9pm and almost everything
is closing up. No dinner at the pub, none at Brumbies, but there seems to be a
light on in the local italian joint. Wandering in, we're greeted by a girl whom
Sharon and I promptly ask if they're still open and could deal with a group of 10.
At this time, it's pretty obvious that she was just closing up, but she wandered
opened the kitchen door and asked the cook if they could deal with us "Shit yeah!"
was the overly enthusiastic reply. So in we went and had the restaurant to
ourselves.
</p>
<p>
We had a great time there. Great tucker and the beer was wonderful too. After
being in the US for so long it was wonderful to chuck back a couple of VBs. I
can't find a decent beer anywhere here in the US - it's all light stuff - ales,
pilsners and lagers. Can't find a bitter anywhere. Yum. Tastes great! After
dinner, it's off back to the lodge. Couple of cartons of beer (Tooheys Old)
and we assume the position - congregating around the pool table with beer in
hand.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, Murray locates a hand-pumped soft rocket. This becomes the toy of the
weekend as we try to shoot each other with the thing. Somewhere about now, its
well after midnight and my brain decides to give in for the day and I head back
downstairs to sleep.
