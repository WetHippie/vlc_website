<h1>WAR Suspension Day</h1>

<p>
In early september 2000 a couple of people from
<a href="http://www.digitalwizards.com.au/">WAR</A> asked me to do a
short seminar on how to set up suspension on motorcycles. A bit theory
and bit practical so they know what to do later on. On a suggestion we
decided to open it up to all of WAR and anyone else that wanted to come
along. A whole day would be spend playing with bits of bikes.
</p>

<h2>The Report</h2>

<p>
As usual, the day started like any other typical WAR organisation. About
9:30 found out that I could get a trailer to bring the BBQ over from
Cyril's place [1]. Err.... shit...hmmm... Ring up Paul (Elle's other
half) to see if I could get a favour and a ute to help cart it over.
Paul arrives at 10:15 and we trundle off to Vic PK to get the barbie.
Arrive back at about 10:40 to find Neil and Kit already here (That'll
teach them to turn up on time to a WAR gig!). Unload BBQ, have the wheel
fall off 3 times on the way wheeling it around the back and the noise of
a couple of V Twins is heard rolling into the Street.
</p>
<p>
Ashley and Marc roll in. Everyone chats for a while and a few more bikes
turn up. Ashley wanders off and the SoBL and supporting crowd (Lisa and
Wade) shows up. The Fizzer is dropped off and we keep chatting. No sign
of KLV yet. SoBL (as do most others) discovers that the concrete is
_very_ slippery due to all the dust from the Paint & Panel shop and
promptly proceeds to arc up the rear tyre of the Blackbird in a burnout.
</p>
<p>
Finally Kelly rocks up making quite an entrance in the Lotus. Everybody
proceeds to oggle that and go for a few drives while I'm furiously
trying to strip down a recalcitrant fork from my spare KR (the banana
shape to it doesn't really help the process).

Eventually we get underway at about 12pm. There's about 8 or 9 people
there now. We make our way though the various terms that you see
cropping up in magazine reviews - rake, trail etc etc. Just as we finish
talking about the swingarm the roar of another bike coming up the street
is heard. As we all try to guess who it is (hmm...not a V-Twin, got a
loud sport's exhaust...) we wander around the front. Shane Rothwell has
turned up on a ZX7R that he's got on a test ride (he'd much earlier
dropped around his FJ12 on a trailer so we could do the forks on it).
After doing the usual tyre kicking he heads off.

As shane leaves one end of the street, Greg Robinson rolls in the other.
Followed in short form by Trevor Calder and a couple of others that I
can't remember. Elle wanders in too, pulls out a horse whip
(accesorising for the evening's party!) and gives Corks a couple in
return for, well, just 'cause he was leaning over looking at a bike.
Eventually we wander off around the back and head into the next session.
</p>
<p>
Now there's about 13 people crowded into the back of the house. Hobzai
made the fatal mistake of sitting between Corks and GregR (are we going
to have to start the G series of numbering people too as we've now got 3
Gregs there!). We start going through the parts that make up a fork
using my now stripped KR fork as a demonstration. We run through how the
spring works (single v double v progressive rate springs), what the
valve does (why do they always talk about "Gold Valves" in magazine
articles) and the seals etc. During this we progress through what
preload and compression and rebound damping do. Much chatting and
explaining particularly about the effects of fork oils, different
values, different springs etc. Somewhere during all of this another
couple of people turn up as well.
</p>
<p>
Lunch is declared. While we get the barbie going, most wander off out
the front. Confirming that they are True Motorcyclists (TM), the guys
completely ignore Kelly's car and drool over all the bikes instead.
</p>
<p>
A whole bunch more drop in for a while. Mr Mono (aka Trevor Hedge),
smelling a group of motorcyclists and a BBQ, drops in, dropping the
customary stoppie to the cheer of the crowd :) Mark Heywood and
girlfriend drop in to show off the brand spanking new ZX9R. Also, while
tucking in, Jason and his wife Crystal also arrive in The Company Car -
a bloody large truck big enough to fit all the bikes in.

After lunch, we have a quick chat what we're going to do to the bikes
and then head off for a quick guided tour ride around the local roads to
show people where some good suspension tests are (and twisties! are).
Throwing caution to the wind, I decide it's about time I got back on a
bike. Rolled the ZX6R out and showed 15 odd bikes around the traps. This
is the first time on a bike since breaking my finger at Wanneroo a month
and a half ago. Certainly attracted the attention of all the locals as
15 sports bikes, just about all with noisy exhausts go screaming around
the local streets.
</p>
<p>
After getting back, everybody takes the FZR for a quick spin in it's
unaltered form. The good thing about this is that the front is in need
of heavier compression damping so it showed to people the things that
we'd spend the morning talking about. While this is happening, the bike
swapping starts. Everyone is riding everything. Kit and Rob get their
first taste of big bike riding too.
</p>
<p>
With the Fizzer riding finished, we proceed to drop it through the
triple clamps at the front - 30mm to be precise. That should be
interesting :) After taking it for a quick blat, Wade jumps on. When he
get's back there's a huge smile and "That's different. Don't know what's
changed, but much better". Now everyone proceeds to ride it around like
that.
</p>
<p>
Time's getting late and Shane has started dismembering the front of his
FJ. Forks come out and we start to strip them. Those that are left now
get a quick lesson on how to strip a set of forks. Unfortunately these
ones required getting a large bolt down the inside to separate the
piston nuts, which we couldn't fabricate at the time. Unfortunately that
killed the rest of the plans for the evening, but everyone got to see
the basic process and just how easy it is to pull apart.

By now it was dark, but a few still hung around. Some coffee and
munchies and that's the end of the evening. Everyone slowly trickles off
home with the last one out around 8pm. Shower, change and I go clubbing
:)
</p>
<p>
Thanks to all that turned up! Was a great day. I really enjoyed it and
hope everyone else did too. Hopefully everyone walked away with a bit of
extra knowledge - particularly after feeling the difference in the FZR
after just making one simple suspension change. I hope to hear lots of
chatter now about people doing changes to their bike to make it feel
better.
</p>
<p>
From what I can remember, here's the roll call for the day. I think
there are a few missing, but with so many faces, it's hard to remember
everyone:

[1] Mark has just today got a 'net connection so expect him to be
chatting on WAR soon. He rides the RD350 that I've been doing all the
work to over the past month. He's also a Chiro and is <I>really</I>
good at putting motorcyclists back together after accidents <TT>:)</TT>
