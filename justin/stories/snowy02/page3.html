At the start of Day 3, things were rather laid back. A gorgeous mountain sunrise
had me out taking photos. Wandering back at about 0700 for a bit of brekkie and
a chat, it seems a number of us hadn't registered yet, and I needed to get a
T-shirt so we headed down to the signup area. After enquiring about the shirts,
there were none left but there was a chance there were still some left in Cooma.
With card in hand, I decided to race off there to get some, telling the others
that I would meet them back at Jindabyne (half hadn't even woken up at this
point).

A brisk ride in the cool morning air was refreshing and soon found myself at
Cooma. With a couple of T-shirts in hand, I meander back to the bike. As I'm
doing the jacket up, I get biffed over the head. Turning around I see the
helmeted face of a mate of mine Mick The Merciless Quigley from back over on
the WAR list when I lived in Perth. He'd warned me he'd be here and it was
good to catch up again. He's now riding a YZF1000 with pillion. After the
usual bit of gasbagging, he tells me to have a look at the visitor centre.
There's a done-up beemer over there. With camera in hand, I wander over to
look at it. The darn thing has a VW engine fitted into the frame. A very nice
job too as it looks like there didn't need to be any modifications done to
the frame at all.

After this, Mick and I decide to head back via Dalgety. There's a fun ride
from there back to meeting the others at Cooma, plus we get the last stamp for
the ride raffle at the end of the day (you only need 3 to enter). Pulling into
the carpark we gain the required stamps and turn around to see a fleet of VFRs
entering. Ah, the boys have woken up obviously. Gordon is there and how has
his own bike - one slightly damaged 02 VFR. Since Graeme couldn't ride at all,
and Gordy's without, a problem was solved. We wander over to show Mick the works
of wonder achieved the night before and then chat about what's happening next.
The others are heading to Cooma to get a stamp, then head back to Jindabyne to
submit the cards and then we'll head off somewhere for the day.

Wandering off up the road back to Jindabyne, we were given a warning by the
others that some cattle were being driven up the road. No sooner were we on the
road when I slowed right down. Cow pats everywhere and not a cow to be seen.
Cautiously heading up the road,we of course encounter the cattle at the best
part of the road - a series of tight corners with long straights between on a
steeeep uphill section. Ah, bugger. :(  Oh well, lots of nice pictures and
it was a struggle trying to not scare the calves with the exhausts of the bike.
I would have hated to startle one (they were all over the road and you had to
ride between them!) and have it run into the bike. Even as littlies they way
a couple of hundred kilos and you won't have a chance of holding the bike up
if they hit you.

Handing my ticket in at Cooma, I settle in to have a look around at the
various bikes that were there. You can do whatever you want during the
day, so long as you get the three stamps required. There's short runs like
what we just did, or you can do the full loop like we did the day before.
Mick organises a test ride for a Valkyrie and ST13000 while I hang around
taking pictures and waiting for the rest to turn up. An hour goes by and
no sign of them. Wonder what they're up to? - too many coffees in Cooma?
Oh well, organise a ride on the Blackbird test bike and off I go. By this time,
it's a couple of hours later and I'm really starting to get pissed at the guys.
No messages on the mobile, nothing. Mick's bought a ticket for lunch at the
top of the Thredbo chairlift so that sounds like a plan. Stuff 'em.
</p>
<p>
A quick jaunt out to Thredbo then takes place. 30km of nice sweepers taken for
the second time in two days, so it's much faster and less scary this time. Pull
up in the carpark and go searching for the chairlift as the lunch ticket is for
the restaurant at the end of the chairlift. This is a great ride and quite a
long one too. The scenery is spectacular as you head up the mountain. There's
still a reasonable amount of snow around for this time of the year and the
temperature - it's hovering around 25-27 during the day. Surprisingly none of
the snow looks like it it is melting.

goes. Next is some ugly guy posing for a photo to prove he really is there.
Finally a view down the chairlift looking at the Thredbo ski village itself.

I'd arrived a little early to the restaurant so I tucked into some food before
the Mick showed up. Sat there admiring the scenery. Some time about now an SMS
turns up from Chris "hi, we've gone to the CAVEs". Prick. Great timing. Only
about 3 hours too late! After calming down and firing off a "thanks a lot you
bastard" message I tucked into a yummy Real Aussie burger and chips, then Mick
shows up. They eaty lunch, we take a few photos and then headed back down the
mountain. The tickets also gave us some free rides on the bobsled at the bottom
of the mountain so we took that on too before needing to head back to Jindabyne
for Mick's test ride appointments (at an abnormally slow pace for me, content
just to sit behind Mick and follow his lines).
</p>
<p>
Arriving back at Jindabyne at about 1540 we find a carpark chockas with bikes
(as you can see on the right. As usual at these sorts of gatherings, there are
all sorts of bikes here. Everything from trikes to cruisers to sportsbikes. Lots
of L-platers, which is great to see. And, one thing that we noticed during the
weekend - the <i>huge</i> numbers of VFRs that have attended. As a rough guess,
probably one in seven bikes was a VFR.
</p>
<p>
While wandering the crowd I come across a very nicely put together Vtr. It's all
yellow, with a lower fairing done in silver. High-mount pipes and other go-fast
bits make it quite a neat looking package, so I strike up a conversation with
the owner, who just happens to be leaning on the bike at the time. Usual stuff
about what's been done to the respective bikes and what other bikes we have and
such and I mention that I'm trying to sell my VFR400 race bike. Seems he has an
interest in acquiring same. So after a few more minutes of chatting I hand him
the contact details and hopefully I've got at least someone interested in it.

After a while, I meander back up to the lodge to see what is going on. Over
time the other riders filter in. Finally it's time to go down to the
presentation, but we have to work out some way of getting Graeme down there.
With his stuffed knee and two walking sticks, he's not going anywhere fast.
As usual, the beer starts talking - mmm.... trolley.... that could be useful.
Graeme, come here! And, as you see, it's a complete success. We "strap" him to
the trolley with a couple of ocky straps, stick his lid on him, just in case
he falls and off we go down the hill. There were some mighty confused looking
people and cage drivers looking at us, but we were ultimately successful in
managing to get him down to the presentation area.

It seems to be rather traditional that the presentation time is going to be
cold and windy. The sun is on its way down and the seabreeze has made its way
inland from the coast. The altitude doesn't help at all either, so it gets
really cold. Fortunately, the guy doing most of the talking is a real barrell
of laughs. He takes the crap out of everyone and everything, and is really
quite good - but I doubt he'd ever get a professional job doing it - jokes are
taken at everyone's expense, including the sponsors, but it is really quite
funny. Unfortunately, none of our group won any prizes, so we left empty handed.
The presentation is over an hour in length and the cold weather is effecting
my bod quite a bit. As soon as the last bit is over I bolt back to the relatively
close lodge to take a leak and hope everyone else will make it back with Graeme
easily.
</p>
<p>
Relief over, I wander upstairs to the comfy lounges and kick back to wait for
the rest to arrive. A few souls wander in like Ross and Julie (that's two of
them in this group!) and Chris. They're taking their time though, so I just
continue to lie on the lounge with the eyes shut. Suddenly there's a loud noise
and lots of clattering and banging coming up the stairs. Opening my eyes I'm
greated to the sight of the trolley that once contained Graeme to now be stacked
to the top with cartons of beer and frozen pizzas. Pity I didn't have a camera
handy because it would have made a great shot. By my recollection, there were
three cases and 12 pizzas strapped to the trolley for the trip. Ah, dinner has
arrived.
</p>
<p>
While the oven is being kicked into gear, the beer is handed out and several
of them attempt to kick the DVD player into life so that we could watch Lord
of the Rings. Appliance skills do not seem to be in their resume. I'm too
pissed off with them to be bothered getting up and helping them, but it's
pretty obvious that a cable wasn't connected up because every time they set
the audio on, nothing was coming out. Sure enough, an hour or so later, the
owners come back and turn around and waddayknow, the audio cables are
unplugged. A couple of pieces of pizza later and I'm feeling a bit tired, so
I wander off to bed for the night.

Waking at my usual crack-of-dawn time I shower, have a quick breakfast and
then jump on the bike to head home. I'm not really interested in riding with
the rest so I just pack the bags and go. As I leave at about 0730, it's still
quite early, so I elect to just head straight home rather than heading up the
twisty Snowy Mountains Highway. There would be a lot of dew on the road and
if I do head that way, I know I wouldn't be able to control myself and probably
end up in the bush due to the slippery pavement. After this, the trip home is
relatively boring. Just highway cruising, sitting on 130 all the way home. I'm
home by eleven, unpack, turn on the cricket, lie back in the lounge and promptly
fall asleep for the next three hours - the preceding days having caught up with
me finally. Next morning, I'm back on the plane to the US.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the bike handled really well once I'd completely sorted the
suspension out. However, I've come to the conclusion that I really do not like
the M1s at all. There is zero feel about what the front of the bike is doing -
you can't tell what the road surface is like, whether the wheel is gripping or
sliding and a lot of other really important details you need to know when
riding hard. That, combined with the fact I seem to be able to effortlessly
spin the rear up (albeit much more controllably than the 207s I once ran on
there), really have me convinced that they aren't a good road tyre. I'm running
208GPs on the RSVR in seattle and they're nice, but I think I'll stick with
the Bridgestones from now on. It's a pity to have to sell the Vtr as it's a
great bike to ride. I really would keep it if it was worth my while, but with
the intention to live in the US for a number of years, and that it would be
close to impossible to get it registered here with the number of mods I've
done to it, means it has to go. Sad to see this one go really. I'll miss it
greatly.
