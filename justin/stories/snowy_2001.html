<h2>Snowy Mountains 2001</h2>

<p>
November 17 was the scene of a large fundraising ride centred around
Jindabyne in the Snowy Mountains region of NSW and ACT. By the quickest route,
that's about 450Km south of where I live in south-western Sydney. That's a
little far to do a day trip, considering we were planning 600km of rides
in the mountains and wanted to be around for the afternoon presentation
at 5pm. Being the bike riders we are, we decided to make a weekend trip -
leaving on Friday morning and getting back Sunday evening. It was a brilliant
trip and I definitely want to go down there again. This is my ride report
that got sent to a few lists, supplemented with photos:
</p>

<p>
Maaaa, I need a new set of tyres!
</p>
<p>
Bloody good ride and many bikes. Approx 1500 entries for the weekend, so
there was probably just fraction less than that actually attended. In
addition, the Triumph mob were having a rally down that way too, so the
place was absolutely crawling with bikes.
</p>
<p>
The most noticable thing - how well behaved <I>every</I> single bike rider
was. In the towns behaviour was impeccable. In the entire weekend I did
not see one wheelie, stoppie or burnout! Even out on the road everybody
was so good. Riders would pull over to let the faster ones through.
Those doing the passing would wait for a clean passing oppourtunity and
no cutting people up on the insides of corners. I only know of two
accidents for the entire weekend (not including a small couple on our
ride on the way down - more later).

<B>Yup, that's a worn out rear tyre. Most of the rubber balls have gone
after the highway trip home. Notice the big cut on the right. Not sure
what that is from.</B>
</p>
<p>
Personal effort was about 1900km. In that time I completely trashed a
rear tyre on the VTR (super-sticky BT010) and the front went from having
a flat patch in the center from highway commuting to now being below the
wear indicators on the edge. So for me the grin factor is huge.

Our trip started at 8am Friday morning meeting at Narellan Maccas (Me -
VTR1000, Burnie - Raptor, Sharon - VFR800, Ross - ST1100). Underway by
about 8:30 we headed down through Picton and Bowral. Skies started nice
a sunny, but by the time we left they were a rather dark grey. As we got
to Bowral the clouds started to descend to come have a chat with us. It
got to the point where we were doing 40km/h in the fog simply because we
couldn't see more than 15m in front. Finding the Kangaroo Valley turn
off was one hell of an experience! As leader, I saw the 200m warning
sign and slowed down to almost walking pace trying to find it. Suddenly
out of the dark came the turn sign to on the left side of the road and I
still managed to miss the turn off! Pulling over, we all get into wet
weather gear as it's still a bit damp :)
</p>
<p>
So off we trundle down to Fitzroy Falls, doing all of 60km/h, and less
at times, due to the fog. Descending down the valley has the fog
clearing, but still plenty of rain. Not the heavy stuff mind you, just
that annoying light drizzle. Traffic is pretty light, which is good as
it makes dealing with the tricky downhill hairpins in the wet easier.
</p>
<p>
Getting to the bottom, I switch off and wait for the others. 5 minutes
pass by before Sharon trundles in - Ross has had a minor accident. So we
head back up the road, only to find Burnie and Ross coming down the hill
about 30 seconds later. After pulling up for go-juice at Nowra, the
story unfolds. Ross was having a bit of a hard time coming down the
mountain at one point (strange, because he was sitting on my rear for
most of it and I wasn't going slowly). Seems he came into a corner and
had the rear lock up on the wet roads. Released and re-applied three
times, each time continuing to lock it up. In the end he's still going a
fraction too fast and so elects to go nose first into the drainage ditch
at walking pace. All is fine until the momentum stops and the bike lays
over on its side. A following pair of riders (ST4 and TDM) see and slow
down to help him pick it up. The Ducati performs a mirror image tumble,
coming to rest a couple of metres away from Ross. So keen was he to help
Ross up that he left his own bike with the engine running, on it's side
with tank downhill and doesn't even seem to care that he's just dumped
his own bike! Ross quickly tells him to look after himself first (not a
good idea to leave an engine running with the oil running in the
cylinder head and not the crankcase). Total damage - one plastic
crashbar protector, a couple of very minor scratches to the fairing and
wounded pride.
</p>
<p>
From there on, the ride was fairly uneventful. Lunch was to be at
Bermagui. Problem was that we'd last filled up at Nowra, and my fuel
light had been on for a very long time (219km on a VTR). While Sharon,
who was leading, was content to wander off into town, the rest of us
staged a mutiny and headed to the second petrol station we found - after
she had ridden past the first one to our dismay! I obviously had nothing
to worry about because there was still half a litre of fuel in the
tank.....
</p>
<p>
After a yummy lunch (hamburgers all-round) off to Bega. _Lovely_ roads
in this part of the world. Burnie and I take off and roll with the
sweepers - 75/85 marked. From Bega, it's up the Snowy Mountains Hwy and
Brown Mountain. What a wonderful piece of road :) Climbing up presented
few problems, except for a petrol tanker and a couple of bike learners.
The higher we got, the more the fog (actually, just low cloud)came in
again. Ross reported not being able to see the front of the tanker it
was that thick at times (being a few minutes ahead by that stage, it was
not that bad for me). As we crested the mountain, the fog lifted and
went into glorious full sunshine. From there it was a full high-speed
run to Cooma. Being the complete hoon I am, that passed very quickly -
including passing a cop car going in the opposite direction at well over
"Tear up license and go straight to jail" speeds - and all they did was
wave! Seems the police knew there was a ride on there during the w/e and
were letting us go (found out later the Coffs Harbour police unit were
having a ride w/e there too). Ooh, lookee here, there's some nice melted
rubber on rear tyre  :) and one very second-hand feeling rear shock (no
damping at all).

<BR>
<B>Bikes everywhere. This is just the parking lot of our accomodation. What
it doesn't show is how steep that area is. All bikes are in gear to stop
them rolling off the sidestands.</B>
</p>
<p>
Through to Jindabyne for our accommodation (Mad Moose Backpackers) and
Burnie gets relegated to another place, because he's just a slacker and
not very organised at all. :P Dinner is had at the Brumby Bar after
taking a walking tour of Jindabyne. Ross crashes out early as he left
home at 5:20 to meet up with us (he's from Newcastle). Cheesecake and
port finishes off the evening and a few games of pool back at the
accommodation.
</p>
<p>
Saturday morning starts off well. All up and breakfast underway by 7:30,
except Sharon who just couldn't be woken up - even after shaking the bed
like an earthquake. Down to the sign up area and purchasing the
obligatory T-Shirt by 8:30. Sharon and Ross sign up for test rides on
the new VFR9^H800 so Burnie and I head off toward Kancoban. Nice bit of
road this. Lots of downhill stuff and see the first of the accidents.
Bike feeling good, rider enjoying himself, getting used to these fun
roads (WA does _not_ have roads like this!). The last 40k into Khancoban
is a ripper, and quite technical - lots of blind lefthanders with the
wall right on the edge of the road, so you have to ride quite a long way
towards the middle of the road. Only had one incident that was worth
mentioning. Kayaking bus coming around the left handed corner in the
opposite direction was on my side of the road and I happen to find one
of the only patches of road with potholes mid-corner so the front starts
to drift towards the bus. Miss by a couple of metres, but the only thing
that rated in the sphincter-puckering scale. Quite a few bikes, but
nobody cutting corners and straying onto the wrong side of the road -
quite unlike The Old Road...

<p>
Meet a Khancoban with Burnie again and then we do our detour out to
Tintaldra. Boring-ish ride out here. Take the photo and then get advice
to go via Tooma rather than backtrack towards Cabramurra. After some odd
map reading (note that maps do not necessarily relate to the locality
that is printed on the cover) we find ourselves flying through a bunch
of sweepers. Nothing too odd here except there's a pile of cars having
some sort of rally coming in the opposite direction (big stickers on 'em
and stuff).
</p>
<p>
Both of us are wondering if the guy has been bullshitting
us. Lots of sweepers is OK, but some tight twisty stuff would be good.
Oh, there's it is and bang from 170km/h sweepers to first gear tight
corners in about 2 turns. That's better! 50 odd km later and we pull
into Cabramurra to refuel. The last 4km in is lovely smooth hotmix so it
was quite a fun little ride.
</p>
<p>
Next stop Adanimaby (try saying that sober, impossible when pissed!) via
the Snowy Mountains Hwy. What a fucking amazing piece of road!!!!
Smooth, hotmix, not a single pothole or repair, and 8 foot high oragne
poles to tell you where the road is going for the next 2 or 3 turns.
That run was serious hoon business. Several times I have to pick my knee
up to make sure it doesn't impact with the road surface (just in
Draggin's, left the (brand-new) leathers at home this weekend). Pulling
up to fill up with more petrol (104km == 12.5L!) reveals a rather
shredded rear tyre and the front ain't looking much better either. Big
streamers of rubber hanging off the rear. Lunch and I head off to
Jindabyne to hand my card in.
</p>
<p>
More fun was had here - big open sweepers, and again another cop car
passes by and waves to me. Back a Jindabyne and it's only 3pm. Too early
to retire so I head off down to Dalgety and back to Berridale. Pick up
another card and more stamps and reverse the trip to arrive back at
about 4pm. Meet Burnie there and we show each other our handiwork while
sitting on the bank watching bikes ride by.
</p>
<p>
Some time later we meet up with Ross and Sharon, clean up and head down
for the presentation. No winners in our group (well, I'm just a big
loser so everyone tells me...) and then wander off trying to find some
food. In the crowd, catch up with Tony and Maggles (aus.moto folks) and
have dinner at Clancies. Rather riotous afair was then had. Sharon and
Rachel lost the plot completely while Tony and I baited each other and
Burnie. :) A couple of games of pool (met up with John Littler and g/f
Alison) and more alcohol later and it's time to fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
Up early again and Sharon wakes up on time today. Breakfast and
discussions on plans. As we eat breakkie, the rain arrives - and the
wind. Considering that the rain drops were travelling horizontally
passed the windows, we decide to scrap plan 1, which was back up the
Snowy Hwy. Ross and Sharon elect for the fast trip home through
Canberra, Burnie and I go via the coast to head away from the weather.
</p>
<p>
Leaving Jindabyne, the rain was still travelling parallel to the ground,
but 20 minutes out and it was bright sunshine and dry roads. More
hooning was had, but the very strong crosswinds made it difficult to be
really stupid on the roads. Down Brown Mtn and basically the reverse
route of the Friday trip. After Bega, had a fun ride with a group of
Ducatis blasting through the hills. Still very little traffic, so it was
pretty good fun.
</p>
<p>
Stopping at Moruya to fill up, we decide to take a quick detour at
Batemans Bay and do the run up the hill to Braidwood and back. Another
excellent run :) Now my rear tyre is completely shot, and so's the rear
shock. (still waiting for the bloody Ohlins to turn up 8 weeks after I
ordered it!) Lunch at Ulladulla and then the trip back to Camden is
through Kangaroo Valley, just to polish of the bits of the tyre that I
may have missed on the rest of the trip. Arrive home at about 6pm.
Wonderful time. Definitely recommend you all attend the trip next year.
I'm definitely interested in doing an overnighter to that area some time
in January. Will take leathers and kneesliders next time....
</p>
<p>
So, an expensive weekend for me. About $400 for food, accommodation and
petrol. Another $500 for a complete set of tyres, and (if I was to
rebuild my current shock, which I'm not) $400 for a rear shock. The last
two items were expenses already planned, but have happened a little
earlier than expected. If you need a nice grippy road tyre, I can very
highly recommend the 010. The 207s that I had before these were just a
piece of crap. I would never buy or recommend set of them. Huge amounts
of grip on standard road surfaces, and held their grip even at high lean
angles and wide open throttle. Considering the absolute flogging I gave
them over the weekend, good amounts of wear. Approx 11,000km for the
front and 7,500km for the rear. Bring on the track day next weekend!
(Being run by two Camden locals - Garry McCoy and Mat Mladin).
