<h2>Changing the Honda Reg/Rec</H2>

<p>
Apart from very poor quality front suspension setups, most Hondas also have
another well-known problem - the regulator/rectifier likes to die at very 
frequent intervals. When it goes, it tends to take other things with it which
can make it a very expensive proposition. For almost everyone, they just buy
a new Honda item and wire it in - only to have it fail again 35K down the road.
This tutorial is to show you how to replace the Honda unit with a non-Honda 
item: something that won't fail. The general setup is common to all Hondas,
but there are some small differences. The photos here are of the conversion
done to my VTR1000 and Blackbird, but it should be similar for all Hondas. 
The VTR photos here were taken by my mate Chris Coote, and the XX pictures 
come from Scot Mahon.

<p>
This is the comparison between the stock Honda-issue r/r on the left and the
R1 unit on the right. Notice the complete lack of cooling fins (this generates
huge amounts of heat - it produces somewhere around 40amps on the output!).
That is one of the primary contributors to the failures - the inability to
keep cool, and the resulting heat/cool cycle destroying the semiconductors
contained inside.
</p>

<p>
Note that 2002 and later model blackbirds have a completely different r/r 
that looks huge. It is mounted on the left side of the subframe rather than
the right side for the pre-2002 models. This new item looks really beefy and
is far bigger than either the old one or the replacement regulator. I seriously
doubt you'd need to replace it. 
</p>


<h3>Knowing when to replace it</h3>

</p>
Firstly, you need to know what is wrong and why. I wrote a long article on the
Blackbird site about <a href="dead_reg.html">How to know if your reg/rec is 
about to die</A>. In addition, here's a nice photo of the plug going into mine:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It was about to fail big time - notice the black ring around the top left item
on the plug on the right. On the left is the new plug to be used. 
</p>

<h3>What to replace it with</h3>

<p>
There are many options with different rectifiers to replace it with. The first 
recommendation is to <i>not</i> use anything that comes from Honda. They're 
crap. Their biggest problem is they are just not capable of producing the 
current required. What you want to do is put on something that can handle the
demands. For this task, we chose a reg/rec from a R1. There's heaps of them
around in wreckers, they've got nice big cooling fins (unlike the Honda unit,
see below) and the number of wires match up. It really doesn't matter what 
brand and model you get, so long as you have at least the same current rating 
as the old unit. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

</p>
This is the fitment on the left side of the subframe on the VTR. The small box
on the left side is the indicator relay for the VTR. That will need to be 
moved somewhere else as the R1 unit is much bigger. 
</p>


<h3>Fitting</h3>

</p>
Fitting a new reg/rec starts by removing the old one. Chop the leads off about
3cm from the plug. If your wiring is getting crispy, trim longer, but try to
cut the old one off as close to the r/r as possible. Next, locate the wiring
from the R1 plug. There should be 5 leads coming from it - three white, a red 
and black. 
</p>

<h4>Using a stock connector</h4>

</p>
To wire up you should match the wires up with the same colour 
leads. The only difference is that the R1 plug will use white wires, which 
correspond to the Honda yellow wires. These may be connected in any order - 
they are just the output of the stator. Note that you <i>must</i> solder the 
leads together and cover them either with heatshrink or electrical tape. Do not
use any sort of crimped endings. There is serious amounts of current going 
through here and the crimped leads will burn up very quickly. 
</p>
<p>
For carbie-fed Hondas, there will only be 5 wires to connect up. Just match 
colour with colour. 
<p>

</p>
<p>
For EFI model Hondas, you will have eight wires, not 5. The DC power leads 
(red and black) are doubled up for some reason. Just connect the two of them to
the corresponding colour lead from the R1 plug. That 
leaves one other lead, which, according to the Blackbird wiring diagram is blue.
This is for sensing starting and if there is another wire (total 9) the other 
is there for headlight-on sensing. These are there to increase output when the lights are
on, and stop charge when starting. They have been proven to NOT help the
later bikes with RR failures. You can safely leave this wire unconnected as it
is not powered. Just remember to tape over the end and tuck it away so you 
don't have a loose wire floating around. 
<p>

<h4>When you don't have a connector</h4>

<p>
If you can't find a connector (the wreckers are unwilling to cut the wiring
loom to sell one to you) then it is fine to just put on a bunch of spade 
connectors directly into the fitting. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="reg_rec/soldered_on_connectors.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</p>

<p>
When you put the connectors onto the wires, make sure you solder them and put
a small amount of heatshrink around each individual connector. To fit the 
wires to the regulator, put the three yellow wires onto the bottom row - 
these come from the stator so it doesn't matter which order you put them in.
The two power wires go to top row - positive on the left and ground on the 
right. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

Finally, tape everything up so that you can't pull the individual connectors
out. I would recomment that you also put a tie-wrap around the wires first 
before taping, about 3cm away from the solder joints.

<h4>Mounting on the bike</h4>

<p>
Once you have completed the soldering, you need to mount the r/r back on the 
bike again. Note that the R1 unit is a hell of a lot bigger. It also means the
bolt patterns may not line up.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to deal with this is to cut the 
lower of the two bolts off the bike. Just use a single bolt through the top of
the unit. Tighten up tight, with the earth lead under it. However, don't use 
loctite as this will break the electrical contact and your bike won't run for 
very long at all. If you think the one bolt is not enough, don't worry. We've 
put a season of racing on it, plus well over 10,000km like that and never had
an issue. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
For the blackbird, the holes do seem to line up because one of the r/r holes 
is elongated. If it doesn't quite fit, just take a small circular file to 
the hole until it does. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Finally tiewrap everything into place. Start the bike up and check the voltage
over the battery terminals. You should see between 12.5 and 14.4V depending on 
revs. If this checks out, fit the bodywork back on the bike and go ride!
