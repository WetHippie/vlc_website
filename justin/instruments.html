<h2>Play</h2>

<p>Play:</p>

<li>Clarinet</li>
<li>Saxophone (Yamaha YTS-64 Tenor, Selmer SA-80 II Alto)</li>
</ul>

<p>My pride and joy: <a href="http://www.foxproducts.com/fox-model-900/">Fox Model 900 Contrabassoon</a>.
Saved up for 15 years to afford it - second most expensive item I own! Now I play it as often as
possible. Sadly, not enough orchestral music makes use of it. :( So when not needed, I play the normal
(tenor) bassoon.</p> 

<h3> Orchestras</h3>

<p>Over the years I have been involved in many community orchestras and bands. Here's a list of those that
I can remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sydney Youth Orchestra</li>
<li>SBS TV Youth Orchestra</li>
<li><a href="http://www.metso.asn.au/">Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra</a> (Perth)</li>
<li><a href="http://southpacificconcertband.webs.com/">South Pacific Concert Band</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eastsidesymphony.org/">Eastside Symphony</a> (Seattle)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.northwestsymphonyorchestra.org/">Northwest Symphony</a> (Seattle)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.raincitysymphony.org/">Rain City Orchestra</a> (Seattle)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.seattlefestivalorchestra.org/">Seattle Festival Orchestra</a> (nee Musicians Emeritus Symphony Orchestra - MESO)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pso.org.au/">Penrith Symphony Orchestra</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these main groups where I have at least been a regular player, I've done call work with most
orchestras within the Seattle and Sydney area over the years.</p>

<h3>Musicals</h3>

<p>As a bassoonist, there is a large call for your skills. There are not many players around, which means
when needing an orchestra for a musical, a phone call is not far away. I've played with all the local
musical/light opera companies in the Sydney area. The following is a selection of musicals that I've
played. There's probably many more that I have forgotten. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pirates of Penzance</li>
<li>Mikado</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Cats</li>
<li>Into the Woods</li>
<li>The Sound of Music</li>
<li>The Gondoliers</li>
<li>H.M.S Pinafore</li>
<li>Oliver</li>
</ul>
