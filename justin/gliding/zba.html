<h1>VH-ZBA</h1>

<ul>
<li><i>What</i>: PZL Swindik PW-5 'smyk'</li>
<li><i>Built</i>: 1997</li>
<li><i>Hours</i>: 1700</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
ZBA is a wrecked PW-5 that we purchased from the Beverley Soaring Society club. It
was an introductory trainer that has been crashed by a relatively inexperienced 
pilot (see below for the original incident report). Due to being a basic trainer
glider, the value was very low. Having it professionally repaired would cost many
multiples of the origina glider's cost, so it was written off and left to sit in
a trailer.i
</p>

<p>I spotted this wreck while inspecting my future <a href="glp.html>LS6</a>
purchase. As a friend and I had been on the lookout for rebuild projects for
some time, this looked like a perfect opportunity - all we had to do was 
get the glider to the other side of the country....
</p>

<h2>The Journey</h2>

<p>
</p>

<h1>Rebuilding</h1>

<h2>Damage Assesment</h2>

<p>The PW-5, as the original 13.5m glider was built extremely lightly. This
permeated into all aspects of the construction. Much of it was built so lightly
that, on a heavy landing, the fuselage basically popped open along all the joins.
The front wheel was pushed up through the cockpit floor, and there were some 
stress cracks - but most of the damage was due to debonding.
</p>

<p> One wing also has a stress crack and delaminated trailing edge due to flexing
in one of the contacts with the ground. Luckily the damage goes from the trailing
edge toward the leading edge, but then takes a turn and travels along the back of
the spar. We've yet to dig in internally, but it appears that the spar is undamaged.
</p>

<h2>Fixing the Wing</h2>

<p>The wing has delaminated and creased approximately 1.5m from the wing root. Both
top and bottom of the wing has been damaged, as well as the trailing edge 
delaminated. As such, the damage is through both skins of the sandwich structure,
requiring replacement of the entire section. This is not a particularly difficult
repair - it just takes a lot of time.
</p>

<h2>Fixing the Fuselage</h2>

<p>The first thing to do was strip the fuselage and find the extent of the damage. 
All the debonded structures had to come out, pushrods removed, pedals and 
instrument panel also removed until we have just a bare shell.
