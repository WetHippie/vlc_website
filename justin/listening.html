<h2>Listen</h2>

<p>Tastes vary widely, but anywhere from DnB to heavy classical. Most of the time on the dance side of
equation.</p>
<p>A close inspection of my CD collection (over 500 CDs and growing!) will reveal that the most popular
labels are from Dancepool (Oz) and React (UK) and Global Underground (UK). In general US dance music is
pretty crappy - way too poppy. I don't know why, but we only really see good stuff from local, UK or
Europe in the clubs, unless of course it is pop-dance type stuff, which nobody seems to know how to
dance to anyway around here.</p>

<h2>Dance</h2>

<p>Yes, dance. As in, I used to dance - a lot. Trilogy Dancers in Perth and assistance instructor at one of the
local Street Latin schools for several years. Still enjoy club dancing a lot, though young kids and family
have stopped most of that now.</p>

<p>Huh? Yup, that's right, For a while, at the insistence of my then roommate, I took some classes in
street latin dancing. An interesting form of dance that-requires lots of hip movement. No, its not the
lambada, but it does similar stuff. Less flashy, more fun. After probably 12 months, I'd ended up being
serious enough that I became one of the assistant instructors, helping teach the newcomers classes, 
along with my dance partner at the time. I continued that for another 12 months or so until I left Perth.
